Install/Uninstall instruction for the Geeklog Net Tools plugin.

INSTALL:

Step 1:  Back up your Geeklog Database.  The Net Tools plugin adds tables to your Geeklog database.  You can do
this with the built in admin backup facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the Net Tools plugin archive while in the <geeklog_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will
create a directory called Net Tools in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html directory (usually public_html) 
create a directory called Net Tools.  Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called Net Tools.

Step 4:  Change to your <geeklog_dir>/plugins/Net Tools/ directory.  Copy the files in the admin directory 
to the admin/plugins/Net Tools/ directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/Net Tools/ directory your created in step 3.

Step 5:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and run install.php in your admin/plugins/Net Tools/ directory.
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not examine Geeklog system errorlog
for possible problems.

The Net Tools plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on the Net Tools Icon will
take you to the admin page.  

Step 7: Set up security.  On install only the root users have access to Net Tools Viewing.  
You can delegate control for either of these functions through the user and group editors.

UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  Run the install.php page in your admin/plugins/Net Tools directory.  This will remove all the data from
your database.

Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  <geeklog-dir>plugins/Net Tools/ 
<public_html>/Net Tools/ and <admin>/plugins/Net Tools/

Thats it.
